#Design of 1024*32 (4kB) SRAM 1.8V with access time &lt; 2.5ns using OpenRAM
This project aims to develop a 1024 *32 (4kB) SRAM with supply voltage 1.8V and access time < 2.5ns. Circuits required as inputs to the OpenRAM compiler are designed and simulated.
**Inputs required for OpenRAM**
•	SRAM Bit cell
•	Sense Amplifier
•	Write Driver
•	Tristate Buffer
•	D-Flip Flop
